### WELCOME TO MY OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING NOTES

This is the result of HOURS of learning via videos and excercises. After 20 hours, here I review the effects of OOP per field/variable and methods. As well as using Super and Sub classes, overloading and overwriting methods.

I will keep adding to this program my notes as I learn more about OOP.

NOTE: this is all after 2 months of studying and playing with Java's Syntax.

_This is the result of the code._

_Feel free to play with the fields and methods to practice. I used InteliJ for the coding._

:hammer_and_wrench: CONSTRUCTOR CALL FOR OBJECT CREATION (from Main class)


this is the SuperClass constructor being called with ►fieldOne◄ and ►fieldTwo◄. (validation from SuperClass)

:heavy_check_mark: 11 ◄◄ this is FieldOne as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)

:heavy_check_mark: a string ◄◄ this is FieldTwo as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)

### :eyes: GETTERS/SETTERS VISIBILITY  (from Main class)

- :heavy_check_mark: __this is fieldOne__ (validation from SuperClass)
- :heavy_check_mark: __this is fieldTwo__ (validation from SuperClass)
- :x: __fieldThreeStatic__ is not accessible via the create object because it is static inside it's Class. Even if this MAIN method is static, it is still protected.
- :heavy_check_mark: __this is fieldFour__ (validation from SuperClass)
- :x: __fieldFiveFS__ is not accessible via the create object because it is static inside it's Class. Even if this MAIN method is static, it is still protected.

#### Hierarchy from __least strict__ to __most strict__ is as follow:
    - public - full access without constructor
    - private - no access without constructor 
    - final - full view possible, no editing allowed
    - static - no access at all, only inside own class

### :warning: DIFFERENCE OF STATIC VS FINAL

- STATIC fields are not visible to outside classes but yes inside and are able to be modified inside their own class.
- FINAL fields are visible but not able to modify.

:question: USING FIELDS IN THE OBJECT'S PARAMETER

To use these fields, we use the getters via the Object constructed.
- _superClassObjectCreatedFromConstructor.getFieldOnePublic()_

### ✏️ TESTING OVERWRITING OF PARAMETERS

- SET only overwrite them but not display them. We need to use the GET to display.
:heavy_check_mark: this is fieldOne (validation from SuperClass)
- fieldOne is __now__ 22
:heavy_check_mark: this is fieldTwo (validation from SuperClass)
- fieldTwo is __now__ another string
:heavy_check_mark: this is fieldFour (validation from SuperClass)
- fieldFour is __always__ 4

### ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ SUBCLASS ACCESS

- this is the SuperClass constructor being called with __►fieldOne◄__ and __►fieldTwo◄__. (validation from SuperClass)
- ✔ __33__ ◄◄ this is FieldOne as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)
- ✔ __>String from SuperClass inside Parameter<__ ◄◄ this is FieldTwo as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)

- ✔ this is fieldOne (validation from SuperClass)
  - Public Field One via subclass: 33
- ✔ this is fieldTwo (validation from SuperClass)
  - Private Field Two via subclass: >String from SuperClass inside Parameter<
- Verify Final field Four Overriding.
- ✔ this is fieldFour (validation from SuperClass)
  - Final Field Four via subclass: 4
- ✔ this is fieldSix (validation from SubClass)
  - Private Field Six from subclass: six 
- ✔ this is fieldSeven (validation from SubClass)
  - Public Field Seven from subclass: seven

### ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ USING OVERRIDING METHOD

this is the SuperClass constructor being called with ►fieldOne◄ and ►fieldTwo◄. (validation from SuperClass)
- ✔ 44 ◄◄ this is FieldOne as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)
- ✔ overriding 1 ◄◄ this is FieldTwo as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)

- ✔ this is fieldOne (validation from SuperClass)
- ✔ this is fieldTwo (validation from SuperClass)
- Verify Final field Four Overriding.
- ✔ this is fieldFour (validation from SuperClass)
- ✔ this is fieldSix (validation from SubClass)
- ✔ this is fieldSeven (validation from SubClass)

#### OVERRIDEN PARAMETERS:
44, overriding 1, 4, overriding 2, overriding 3

#### OVERRIDING CHECK 
if it overwrites previous object.
- ✔ this is fieldOne (validation from SuperClass)
  - First Object, fieldOne: 33
- ✔ this is fieldOne (validation from SuperClass)
  - Second Object, fieldOne: 44
#### It does not ✔

### OVERRIDING CLASS
_Same name, same parameters, SubClass extended from SuperClass._
- This is the original text of the OverridingClass.
- This is the overriden text of the OverridingClass.

### ⚠️ DIFFERENCE OF OVERLOADING VS OVERRIDING
- OVERLOADING: using same name but different type or parameters for the class, inside the same class.
- OVERRIDING: what I did using the SubClass parameters to go on top of the SuperClass parameters.
