### WELCOME TO MY OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING NOTES

This is the result of HOURS of learning via videos and excercises. After 20 hours, here I review the effects of OOP per field/variable and methods. As well as using Super and Sub classes, overloading and overwriting methods.

I will keep adding to this program my notes as I learn more about OOP.

NOTE: this is all after 2 months of studying and playing with Java's Syntax.

_This is the result of the code._

_Feel free to play with the fields and methods to practice._

:hammer_and_wrench: CONSTRUCTOR CALL FOR OBJECT CREATION (from Main class)


this is the SuperClass constructor being called with ►fieldOne◄ and ►fieldTwo◄. (validation from SuperClass)

:heavy_check_mark: 11 ◄◄ this is FieldOne as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)

:heavy_check_mark: a string ◄◄ this is FieldTwo as called inside the --Objects' parameters-- not the --Constructor--. (validation from SuperClass)

:eyes: GETTERS/SETTERS VISIBILITY  (from Main class)

- :heavy_check_mark: this is fieldOne (validation from SuperClass)
- :heavy_check_mark: this is fieldTwo (validation from SuperClass)
- :x: fieldThreeStatic is not accessible via the create object because it is static inside it's Class. Even if this MAIN method is static, it is still protected.
- :heavy_check_mark: this is fieldFour (validation from SuperClass)
- :x: fieldFiveFS is not accessible via the create object because it is static inside it's Class. Even if this MAIN method is static, it is still protected.

:warning: DIFFERENCE OF STATIC VS FINAL

- STATIC fields are not visible to outside classes but yes inside and are able to be modified inside their own class.
- FINAL fields are visible but not able to modify.

:question: USING FIELDS IN THE OBJECT'S PARAMETER

To use these fields, we use the getters via the Object constructed.
- _superClassObjectCreatedFromConstructor.getFieldOnePublic()_

✏️ TESTING OVERWRITING OF PARAMETERS

- SET only overwrite them but not display them. We need to use the GET to display.
:heavy_check_mark: this is fieldOne (validation from SuperClass)
- fieldOne is __now__ 22
:heavy_check_mark: this is fieldTwo (validation from SuperClass)
- fieldTwo is __now__ another string
:heavy_check_mark: this is fieldFour (validation from SuperClass)
- fieldFour is __always__ 4
